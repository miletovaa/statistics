# üìä Statistics Course Repository

This repository contains assignments completed as part of the Statistics course. It serves as both a record of my progress and a **showcase of the concepts and methods we‚Äôve covered throughout the semester**.

## ‚≠ê Knowledge 
- Descriptive statistics: central tendency, variability, outliers, distribution shapes
- Inferential statistics: t-tests (1-sample, 2-sample, paired), chi-squared test, correlation
- Probability theory: binomial distribution, PMF/CDF, simulation
- Normality checks: Q-Q plots, transformation strategies
- Data storytelling: drawing insights from real datasets (wine quality, student surveys)

## ‚≠ê Skills Demonstrated
- Data analysis and visualization in R with ggplot2, dplyr, tidyverse
- Hypothesis testing with correct statistical test choice and interpretation
- Power analysis and sample size estimation using pwr and power.t.test()
- Writing custom R functions for automation (e.g. plotting, Q-Q plot comparison)
- Communicating statistical results clearly through annotated plots and commentary
- Various plot types interpretation

### ‚ö° Final assignment

A larger project that summarizes the skills learned throughout the course, combining:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visual comparisons using ggplot2
- Statistical interpretation and conclusions
- Statistical test and correlation

The main dataset used is the Wine Quality Data Set (![red wine](https://github.com/miletovaa/statistics/blob/main/Assignment/winequality-red.csv) and ![white wine](https://github.com/miletovaa/statistics/blob/main/Assignment/winequality-white.csv) subsets), which offers a great playground for comparing characteristics of red and white wines.
